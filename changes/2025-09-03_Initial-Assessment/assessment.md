# Enterprise Assessment — RainmeterManager (2025-09-03)

## 1. Architecture and design
- Observed
  - Core C++ application with Windows-first design (Direct2D/DirectWrite; optional Skia via CMake)
  - Strong bootstrap (SEH, DPI awareness, COM), singleton application core (RAINMGRApp), service locator pattern, and centralized configuration manager
  - Security foundation: WinTrust code-signing verification, BCrypt providers, DPAPI usage, and content scanning
- Risks
  - Interface drift: mixed API patterns across Logger/Security vs. Phase 2 code references
  - Project drift: Visual Studio project likely not fully aligned with current sources
- Recommendations
  - Introduce thin adapter layers (Logger/Security) to unify interfaces without touching established internals
  - Keep Direct2D as primary; leave Skia optional and off-by-default until stabilized; add renderer toggles later via CMake option

## 2. Code quality
- Strengths
  - Logging framework with levels, async queue option, stack traces; comprehensive error-handling macros
  - Clear modularization: app/core/ui/widgets; service locator and config layers in place
- Gaps (quick wins)
  - Signature mismatch in splash_screen (OnPaint)
  - Namespace qualification in main.cpp for RAINMGRApp
  - Adapter gaps for Core::Logger and Core::Security expected APIs
- Plan
  - Apply minimal diffs (0001–0003) to resolve compilation/linker issues; keep all logic intact

## 3. Security posture
- Baseline
  - Code-signature validation (WinVerifyTrust), BCrypt AES/SHA providers, DPAPI integration, malicious pattern scanning, extension validation
- OWASP ASVS (Level 2, adapted for desktop)
  - Cryptographic storage: DPAPI for secrets at rest (adapter to expose encrypt/decrypt APIs)
  - Code integrity: verify signatures of binaries and packages; log anomalies
  - Input validation: strict parsing for .rmskin/.rmskinx, domain allowlists from dependencies.json
  - Error handling: no sensitive leakage; minidumps protected
  - Update security: when added, signed updates over HTTPS with certificate pinning
- Supply chain (SLSA goals)
  - CI builds; SBOM generation; provenance where possible; dependency pinning; immutable artifacts

## 4. Build and test
- Current
  - Dual build surfaces (VS2022 project and CMake); robust scripts (verify_dependencies.ps1, buildscript.bat, ci_build.bat)
  - tests/CMakeLists.txt placeholder; no unit tests yet
- Actions
  - Align VS project AdditionalDependencies and sources; add adapters to both VS and CMake
  - Add minimal GoogleTest suite (adapter roundtrips, service locator), integrated with CTest

## 5. CI/CD
- Baseline (to add)
  - GitHub Actions workflow: build Debug/Release, run tests, upload artifacts and SBOM
  - Optional Azure Pipelines stub later
- Hardening
  - Caching (CMake, vcpkg if introduced), artifact retention, reproducibility notes, release provenance

## 6. Performance & reliability
- Strengths
  - Logger with optional async mode; dbghelp stack traces; performance timers and macros
- Opportunities
  - Tune log rotation strategy; consider enabling async logging by default in Release
  - Instrument render loop timing and splash animations for frame pacing

## 7. Documentation & governance
- Add
  - SECURITY.md (ASVS Level 2 mapping), CONTRIBUTING.md (diff-first policy), CODEOWNERS; later ADRs for adapters and packaging
- Update
  - README: clear build instructions (CMake and VS), toggles for optional Skia, packaging/validation commands

## 8. Packaging & distribution
- Plan
  - Extend .rmskin into .rmskinx: manifest with hashes, optional signatures, and a PowerShell validator (preflight self-test)
  - Gate publishing on validator + signature checks; no telemetry

## 9. Roadmap (phased)
- Phase A: Adapters + minimal fixes (0001–0005), baseline builds green
- Phase B: Test scaffold (0006) and CI (0008)
- Phase C: Security hardening (DPAPI usage paths, HTTPS-only toggles, allowlists)
- Phase D: Packaging validator and sample .rmskinx flow
- Phase E: CI/CD maturity and provenance
- Phase F: Docs/governance and ADRs

## Notes on repository documents
- audit.md and progress reports indicate extensive “Phase 2 COMPLETE” work (application core, testing categories). Code shows strong foundations and some interface drift. We will resolve drift with adapters and keep behavior unchanged.
