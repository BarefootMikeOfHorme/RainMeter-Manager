# Initial Assessment Notes — 2025-09-03

These notes capture the current state of the repository, initial observations, verification checklists, and conventions for changes/diffs going forward. They are meant to be a living record for this assessment cycle.

## 1) Context and objectives
- Repository: C:\Users\Administrator\RainmeterManager (junction to D:\RainmeterManager)
- OS/runtime: Windows 10/11 (Windows-only target for now)
- Toolchain: Visual Studio 2022 (v143 toolset), CMake (>=3.14), Windows SDK
- Rendering: DirectX/Direct2D + DirectWrite (SkiaSharp optional/fallback per CMake)
- Languages: C++ core; future ability to leverage scripts (Python, Rust) when needed
- Policies: No telemetry/data collection; enterprise-grade security and compliance; repair/enhance (no rewrites)
- Goal of this assessment: Stabilize builds, eliminate mismatches with minimal diffs, add a thin test/CI baseline, and set up secure packaging and governance for marketplace readiness.

## 2) Inventory (snapshot)
Top-level
- .gitignore, README.md, LICENSE / LICENSE.txt
- CMakeLists.txt, RainmeterManager.sln, RainmeterManager.vcxproj
- dependencies.json, audit.md, ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md, ENTERPRISE_PROGRESS_REPORT.md, RENDERCORE_IMPLEMENTATION_*.md
- Directories: cmake/, src/, resources/, scripts/, tests/, widgets/ (subtrees), docs/ (present), examples/ (present)

Build/config
- cmake/FindSkiaSharp.cmake (optional Skia discovery)
- scripts/verify_dependencies.ps1, scripts/buildscript.bat, scripts/ci_build.bat

Core sources
- src/app: main.cpp; rainmgrapp.h/.cpp (RAINMGRApp singleton; namespace RainmeterManager::App)
- src/core: logger.h/.cpp; security.h/.cpp; debug.h; error_handling.h; service_locator.h/.cpp
- src/config: config_manager.h/.cpp

UI and widgets
- src/ui: ui_framework.h; widget_ui_manager.h; splash_screen.h/.cpp (cinematic water-themed splash; D2D/DWrite/WASAPI)
- src/widgets/framework: widget_framework.h (large; streams, embeds, WebView2)
- src/widgets/community: community_feedback.h; community_feedback_integration.cpp
- src/widgets/templates: weather_widget.h (and others per docs)

Resources and tests
- resources/resource.rc (icons/manifests expected)
- tests/CMakeLists.txt (placeholder infrastructure; no unit tests yet)

## 3) Observations and mismatches to repair (minimal diffs)
- Logger interface divergence
  - Phase 2 code references RainmeterManager::Core::Logger::GetInstance().LogWide(...)
  - Present logger.h/.cpp expose a static/global Logger without Core:: namespace or LogWide/GetInstance.
  - Plan: Add a thin Core::Logger adapter mapping to existing Logger (no rewrite of logger).

- Security adapter gap
  - Phase 2 components expect Core::Security::Initialize/Cleanup/EncryptString/DecryptString.
  - Present security.h/.cpp implement hashing, WinTrust verification, BCrypt/DPAPI providers, pattern scanning — but not the exact string encrypt/decrypt API.
  - Plan: Add a DPAPI-backed Core::Security adapter exposing the expected methods and forwarding provider init/cleanup.

- UI signature mismatch
  - splash_screen.h declares OnPaint(HDC), while splash_screen.cpp implements OnPaint() with no parameters.
  - Plan: Harmonize signatures with minimal change (prefer matching current call sites).

- Namespace qualification
  - main.cpp uses RAINMGRApp; header defines RainmeterManager::App::RAINMGRApp.
  - Plan: add a using or fully qualify in main.cpp (one-line change).

- Visual Studio project drift
  - vcxproj may miss some Phase 2 sources and/or required Windows libs under AdditionalDependencies.
  - Plan: Update ItemGroups to include rainmgrapp.cpp, service_locator.cpp, config_manager.cpp, and new adapters; ensure bcrypt, crypt32, wintrust, dbghelp, version, d2d1, dwrite, windowscodecs, shcore, user32, gdi32 are linked in Debug/Release x64.

- Tests absent
  - Plan: Add a minimal GoogleTest scaffold (CTest) with smoke tests for the adapters and service locator.

## 4) Verification checklist (to run per patch wave)
Builds
- CMake: configure + build Debug/Release (Visual Studio 17 2022, x64)
- Visual Studio: build solution Debug/Release x64; ensure no unresolved externals

Runtime smoke
- Launch executable; splash shows and dismisses; logs folder created; no crash on exit
- Security: code signature check runs; DPAPI encrypt/decrypt roundtrip succeeds in tests

Quality
- Warnings: tally per config; top offenders tracked in notes
- Scripts: verify_dependencies.ps1 reports success

Artifacts
- changes/ contains numbered patch files (created with git format-patch), notes, and references
- CI artifacts uploaded (binaries, PDBs, SBOM) when CI added

## 5) Change/diff conventions
- All modifications are proposed as minimal, reviewable diffs; no rewrites
- Patches are numbered (0001-*, 0002-*, …) and stored under changes/YYYY-MM-DD_Label/
- Each patch/commit carries a rationale, files touched, and verification steps here
- Once CI is added, patches must go green (build+tests) before merging

## 6) Planned patches (summary)
- 0001: Core::Logger adapter; include in consumers expecting Core::Logger
- 0002: Core::Security adapter (DPAPI encrypt/decrypt + provider init/cleanup)
- 0003: Namespace/signature fixes (main.cpp, splash_screen)
- 0004: Visual Studio project parity (sources + AdditionalDependencies)
- 0005: CMake parity (add adapters; ensure Windows libs)
- 0006: Minimal test scaffold (gtest + CTest; adapter roundtrips)
- 0007: Installer stub/gating (avoid build breaks if NSIS missing)
- 0008: GitHub Actions CI (build Debug/Release; ctest; SBOM)
- 0009: .rmskinx schema + validator (PowerShell) for self-testable packages
- 0010: Azure Pipelines stub (optional later)
- 0011: Governance docs (SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODEOWNERS)

## 7) Next steps
1) Capture baseline build errors and warnings (CMake and VS)
2) Implement 0001–0003 (adapters + minimal fixes)
3) Update VS/CMake (0004–0005), then re-run builds
4) Add test scaffold + CI (0006, 0008)
5) Introduce packaging validator and docs (0007, 0009, 0011)

This file will be updated as we proceed with each patch and verification.
