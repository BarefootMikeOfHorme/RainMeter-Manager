- C++ build failing due to missing MSVC targets (Microsoft.Cpp.Default.props). Install/repair Desktop development with C++ workload or C++ build tools for VS 2022 (v143) to resolve.
- Some C# errors indicate duplicate type definitions and missing references (e.g., WebView2, System.Drawing.Color). We'll triage next.
