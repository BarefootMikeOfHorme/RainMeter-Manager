RainmeterManager Beta Non-Commercial License (RB-NC-1.1)

IMPORTANT: This document is provided for informational purposes and does not constitute legal advice. Consult an attorney to determine suitability for your use.

0. Scope and Intent
This license governs use of RainmeterManager pre-release versions, including any build or tag labeled alpha, beta, preview, rc, canary, or matching v1.0.0-* suffixes, and any version prior to the final v1.0.0 release (collectively, "Pre-Release"). It is designed to:
- allow free non-commercial building, testing, evaluation, and experimentation;
- protect ownership and authorship (maintainers and contributors);
- enable future re-licensing for a premium commercial store release.

1. Definitions
- "Software" means the RainmeterManager source code and accompanying materials in this repository.
- "Maintainers" means Michael D Shortland (aka BarefootMike) and authorized collaborators.
- "Non-Commercial Use" means use that is not intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including internal evaluation, personal use, education, research, and testing.
- "Contribution" means any work of authorship you submit to this project (e.g., via pull request).

2. Grant of Rights (Pre-Release Only)
Subject to this license, Maintainers grant you a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to, during the Pre-Release only:
- use, copy, build, test, and modify the Software solely for Non-Commercial Use;
- create derivative works for Non-Commercial Use; and
- share unmodified or modified copies for Non-Commercial Use, provided you include this license and preserve attribution and notices.

3. Restrictions
You may NOT:
- use the Software, in whole or in part, for Commercial Use, including selling, licensing, hosting as a service, or distributing with any product or service for a fee;
- distribute the Software or derivatives via app stores or other commercial channels;
- remove or alter attribution, copyright, license, or notice files;
- use Maintainers’ names, marks, or branding to endorse or promote products without written permission.

4. Third-Party Components
Third-party libraries included with or referenced by the Software are licensed under their own terms. This license does not grant rights to third-party components. See the NOTICE file for attributions and links.

5. Contributions and Re-Licensing
By submitting a Contribution, you agree that:
- License to Maintainers: You grant the Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform/display, sublicense, and re-license your Contribution in any form, including under different terms for future commercial releases.
- Patent License from Contributors: To the extent you have patent rights that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution, you grant the Maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contribution (alone and as part of the Software), including for future commercial releases.
- Authorship: Maintainers will use reasonable efforts to preserve authorship attribution in source history and project acknowledgments. This clause is aspirational and does not create a warranty or obligation to publish.
- DCO: You certify you have the right to submit the Contribution and license it as above (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
If you cannot grant these rights, do not contribute.

6. Maintainers’ Patent Notice
Except as expressly stated in Section 2 for Non-Commercial Use during the Pre-Release, Maintainers do not grant any patent rights to recipients. Any future patent licenses (if any) will be provided under the terms of the future release’s license or EULA.

This license does not grant permission to use RainmeterManager, BarefootMike, or other Maintainers’ names, logos, or trademarks. Any such use requires prior written permission.

8. Future Commercial Release
Maintainers may release later versions (including v1.0.0 and later) under different terms, including a commercial EULA for a premium app store release. This license applies only to Pre-Release versions. Your rights to any version are governed by the license accompanying that version.

9. Warranty Disclaimer
