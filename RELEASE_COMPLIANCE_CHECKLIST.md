### ⏰ Estimated Timeline

**Optimistic (Aggressive):** 6-8 weeks
- Phase 1 fixes: 2 weeks
- Phase 2 security: 1 week
- Phase 3 testing: 2 weeks
- Phase 4-6 parallel: 2 weeks
- Beta testing: 1 week minimum

**Realistic (Recommended):** 10-14 weeks
- Phase 1 fixes: 3-4 weeks (crash is complex)
- Phase 2 security: 2 weeks (includes code signing cert acquisition)
- Phase 3 testing: 3-4 weeks (proper test implementation and coverage)
- Phase 4-6 parallel: 2-3 weeks
- Beta testing: 4+ weeks (extended period recommended)

**Conservative (Safest):** 16-20 weeks
- Includes buffer for unexpected issues
- Extended beta testing period
- Third-party security audit
- Comprehensive accessibility testing
